To configure this module, you need to:

- Go to *Point of sale > Configuration > Point of sale*
- Select the point of sale for which you wish to change the logo.
- Set the *Alternative point of sale logo* setting on and upload the desired logo.

From now on, that point of sale will print that logo, while the others will print the
company one.
