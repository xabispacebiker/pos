This module allows to display in POS interface the discount applied to customer, calculated as difference between POS final price and price from a specific pricelist set in POS configuration.


This can be useful to provide customer an explicit reference of the discount applied from a "standard" pricelist, without the need to have the the POS pricelist based on the "standard" pricelist.
